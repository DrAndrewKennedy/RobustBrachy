# How to Install

There are two versions of the RobustBrachy Python package: 
1. one that runs a majority of the code on Nivida **GPUs** (files end with '_gpu')
2. the other that runs on **CPU only** (files end with '_cpu').

It is recommended to create a virtual environment using Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) to run RobustBrachy in, allowing RobustBrachy to work with the tested package dependencies and Python versions. You can create the Anaconda virtual environment that suits your purposes using either **'GPU'** or **'CPU only'** instructions below.

> [!NOTE]
> RobustBrachy has only been tested in Windows 11.

## Create a Virtual Environment

### GPU-enabled Virtual Environment
1. clone or download the RobustBrachy package zip from GitHub to your local machine and extract the repository if you haven't already.

2. start an Anaconda prompt

3. change the directory to where the RobustBrachy repository was saved. (the environment_gpu.yml should be in the directory)

4. install a new virtual environment by typing the following command:
```
conda env create --file "environment_gpu.yml"
```

5. Download and install Nvidia CUDA Toolkit version 10.2 with filename "cuda_10.2.89_441.22_win10.exe" by downloading it from "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.2-download-archive" and making the appropriate selections.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the latest version, but it was found that the speed for RobustBachy decreased with more recent Nvidia CUDA Toolkits and CuPy versions.

### CPU-only Virtual Environment
1. clone or download the RobustBrachy package zip from GitHub to your local machine and extract the repository if you haven't already.

2. start an Anaconda prompt

3. change to the directory to where the RobustBrachy repository was saved. (the environment_cpu.yml should be in the directory)

4. install a new virtual environment by typing the following command:
```
conda env create --file "environment_cpu.yml"
```

## Install the RobustBrachy package
There are two methods to install RobustBrachy.  

- **Method 1:** Using git and installing RobustBrachy from the cloud (the RobustBrachy GitHub repository). 
- **Method 2:** Using a local copy of the RobustBrachy GitHub repository.

> [!CAUTION]
> If using the CUDA GPU capabilities of RobustBrachy, it is recommended to follow the "creating a GPU-enabled Virtual Environment" above.

### Method 1: Using git
1. download and install a git client if one is not already installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   
2. start an Anaconda prompt and activate the virtual environment by typing the following command:
```
conda activate robust 
```
> [!NOTE]
> robust is the name given to the virtual environment from the "environments_cpu.yml" and "environments_gpu.yml" files

3. Update setuptools by typing the following commands:
```
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
```
pip install --upgrade build
```

4. install RobustBrachy by typing the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/DrHazza/RobustBrachy.git
```

### Method 2: Uisng a local copy
1. clone or download the RobustBrachy package zip from GitHub to your local machine and extract the repository if you haven't already.
2. start an Anaconda prompt
3. activate the virtual environment by typing the following command:
```
conda activate robust 
```
4. Update setuptools by typing the following commands:
```
pip install --upgrade setuptools
pip install --upgrade build
```
5. change to the directory of RobustBrachy where the "pyproject.toml" file is.
6. install by typing the following commands: 
```
python -m pip install .
```

## Running the HDR_prostate_robust_app streamlit webapp
1. start an Anaconda prompt
2. activate the virtual environment by typing the following command:
```
conda activate robust 
```
3. change to the directory of the 'HDR_prostate_robust_app' folder where the "HDR_prostate_robust_app.py" file is located.
4. run a streamlit instance by typing the following command:
```
streamlit run HDR_prostate_robust_app.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A browser window popup should appear with the user interface of the robust app running locally. If not, an instance of the app can be started by clicking the 'http://localhost:????' link in the Anaconda prompt window or copying and pasting the address into a browser window.

# Examples
## Example Treatment Plan DICOMS
The example treatment plan was created from a phantom with a small prostate volume. The small volume causes large variations in DVH metrics as uncertainty shifts are applied to needles and other structures. Although this plan provides an adaquate test plan to explore the features of RobustBrachy, the intention soon is to provide an example plan with a prostate volume that more examplifies the average patient undergoing HDR prostate brachytehrapy.
## Example Python Scripts
Python scripts demonstrating example uses of the RobustBrachy package are found in the root directory of this github repository, split into using cpu only and using gpu acceleration. 
- Nominal plan anaylsis example does a fast TG43 dose calculation and outputs the DVH plots and DVH metrics.
- Robust Evaluation of a single nominal treatment plan, outputing probablistic robustness pass-rates for each DVH metric and the DVH plot with robustness bands.
- Robust Optimiser that outputs a table containing probabilistic robustness pass-rates for all plans on the pareto front and nominal DVH metrics for each robust plan.
- Selecting one Robust optimisted treatment plan to explore further, DVH plot with robustness bands and generated treatment plan DICOM files.
